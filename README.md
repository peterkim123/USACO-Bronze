# USACO-Bronze

This is a compilation of a bunch of USACO solutions of problems that I've done to try to practice. I have no personal guidance in this new area of exploration that I've grasped. My mom doesn't know the first thing about computers and my father is only highly knowledgeable on basic logic but not technical in algorithmic programming and logical programming. My mom has signed me up for different online courses but these are merely just applications of my fundamental base that I already have. The problem that I have is the unability to process my fundamental base towards the different problems that are intuitively simple in terms of programming, especially in bronze. I have little experience in applicatory programming with data strucutres and I have no guiding hand on how to set upon each problem other than the vague solutions of the USACO website that I have heavily relied on.
